# Dot files for Mac OS
Files I place in my Mac home folder computers.

## Notes: (for you and me)
* All (non-dot) files here must be renammed with a dot at the beginning, and placed in the home directory. (Except README.md)
* My `.vim` directory and `.vimrc` file are not here, but in another repository: [Webastien Vim configuration](https://github.com/webastien/vim).
* **This is incomplete**, because: Some of those files contains specific / private things, but push it anyway on github to keep a trace.
* The `bash_profile` file references another dot file I didn't include in this repository: `.git-completion.bash`, which allows `git` command auto-completion. it can be downloaded from [Git repository](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash).
* The `.gitconfig` file is also incomplete because I don't want to pubish my settings like username and email here.
* `.bash_sessions_disable` is a personal choice (for now), because one of my machines crash often and I got lots of files in `.bash_sessions`.
* On linux machine, some parts of `.bash_profile` should be in a `.bashrc`
